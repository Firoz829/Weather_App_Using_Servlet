# Weather App 🌦️

## Description
This is a simple yet dynamic **Weather Application** where users can **enter a city name** to **search and view real-time weather information**.  
The app fetches weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays it beautifully.

Depending on the weather conditions, the **background images** change automatically to match the mood — like sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc. 🌤️🌧️❄️
